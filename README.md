# Richard Menken - Technical Writing Portfolio
Welcome to my GitHub page, which provides examples of technical documentation I have created during my career as a technical writer. 
## About Me
I am a Senior Technical Writer with 20+ years of experience creating technical documentation for software and manufacturing industries. I have a proven ability to write clear, concise, and detailed documentation for a wide range of audiences, including complex technical guides for developers and engineers and easy-to-follow manuals for customers. I have experience managing multiple documentation projects simultaneously and working collaboratively with cross functional teams in a fast paced environment. I am very knowledgeable of the software development process and I have experience working in an Agile Scrum environment. I have a strong background in graphic design and I am adept at augmenting documentation with illustrations, photographs, and videos.
